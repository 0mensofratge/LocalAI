If you want to play Resident Evil Zero on your N64 emulator, you will need to find a ROM file that contains the game data. A ROM file is a copy of the game cartridge that can be played on an emulator. However, finding a ROM for Resident Evil Zero on N64 is not easy, because the game was never officially released for that system.
 
The development of Resident Evil Zero on N64 was cancelled in 2000, due to technical limitations and the upcoming launch of the GameCube. Only a few prototype cartridges were made, and they are very rare and expensive. Some of these prototypes have been leaked online, but they are incomplete and buggy versions of the game.
 
One way to download a ROM for Resident Evil Zero on N64 is to use a website that hosts ROM files for various systems. You can search for "resident evil 0" or "biohazard 0" in the Nintendo 64 section of these websites, and you might find some results. However, be careful when downloading ROM files from unknown sources, as they might contain viruses or malware. Also, downloading ROM files might be illegal in your country, depending on the copyright laws.
 
Another way to download a ROM for Resident Evil Zero on N64 is to use a mod that replaces the title screen and some graphics of another N64 game with those of Resident Evil Zero. For example, there is a mod that changes Super Mario 64 into Resident Evil Zero by using assets from the GameCube version. You can download this mod from [Mod DB](https://www.moddb.com/games/resident-evil-0-biohazard-0-hd-remaster/downloads/n64-title-screen-mod), and then apply it to a Super Mario 64 ROM using a patching tool. However, this mod does not change the gameplay or the story of Super Mario 64, so it is not a true conversion of Resident Evil Zero.
 
In conclusion, downloading a ROM for Resident Evil Zero on N64 is possible, but not easy or recommended. You might be better off playing the game on another platform, such as the GameCube or the PC, where you can enjoy the full and polished version of this survival horror classic.
  
If you are still interested in playing Resident Evil Zero on N64, you might want to know more about the history and the features of this cancelled game. According to [Unseen64](https://www.unseen64.net/2008/04/09/resident-evil-0-zero-n64/), a website that documents unreleased and beta games, Resident Evil Zero on N64 was in development from 1998 to 2000 by Capcom and Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego). The game was supposed to use the same engine and graphics as Resident Evil 2 on N64, which was praised for its impressive compression and optimization techniques.
 
Resident Evil Zero on N64 was intended to introduce some new gameplay mechanics to the series, such as the partner zapping system, which allowed the player to switch between Rebecca and Billy at any time, and the item dropping system, which let the player leave items on the ground instead of using item boxes. The game also had some unique locations and enemies that were not seen in the GameCube version, such as a factory, a submarine, and a giant bat.
 
However, Resident Evil Zero on N64 faced several challenges during its development. The game had to fit into a 64 MB cartridge, which limited the amount of content and quality that could be included. The game also had to compete with other survival horror games that were using more advanced technology, such as Silent Hill on PlayStation and Code Veronica on Dreamcast. Moreover, the game had to be ready for the launch of the GameCube, which was planned for 2001. Therefore, Capcom decided to cancel the N64 version and move the project to the GameCube, where they could use more resources and features.
 
Resident Evil Zero on N64 remains one of the most sought-after lost games in the history of gaming. Only a handful of prototype cartridges are known to exist, and they have been sold for thousands of dollars on online auctions. Some fans have tried to recreate or restore the game using emulation and hacking tools, but they have not been able to complete it or fix all the bugs. The closest thing to playing Resident Evil Zero on N64 is watching some gameplay videos or screenshots that have been leaked online over the years.
