Tip: When you compile a custom kernel from source code, the default behavior is to also compile all the kernel modules that provide additional functionality. This can take a long time and may not be necessary if you only want to update some parts of the kernel or build some specific modules. To speed up the process and customize the modules you want to build, you should modify the /etc/make.conf file before you start the kernel compilation:

The /etc/make.conf file contains various settings that affect the kernel compilation process. For example, you can specify the number of parallel jobs to run, the optimization level for the compiler, the location of the kernel source code, and the modules you want to include or exclude. You can use any text editor to edit this file, but make sure you have root privileges.
  
Building a custom kernel can have several benefits, depending on your needs and preferences. For example, you can optimize the kernel for your specific hardware configuration, enable or disable features that are not available in the default kernel, improve the security and stability of your system, and reduce the size and memory footprint of the kernel.
  
However, building a custom kernel also has some drawbacks and risks. For example, you may encounter errors or bugs during the compilation process, break some functionality or compatibility with other software or devices, or make your system vulnerable to new exploits or attacks. Therefore, you should always backup your data and configuration files before building a custom kernel, and test it thoroughly before using it as your main kernel.
  
Backing up your data and configuration files is a good practice before making any major changes to your system, such as building a custom kernel. You can use various tools and methods to backup your data, such as copying them to an external drive, using a cloud service, or creating a disk image. You should also backup your configuration files, such as /etc/fstab, /etc/rc.conf, and /boot/loader.conf, which contain important settings for your system.
  
Testing a custom kernel is a crucial step before using it as your main kernel. You can test a custom kernel by booting it from a USB drive or a separate partition, or by using a virtual machine. You should check if the custom kernel boots properly, if all the devices and drivers work correctly, if the performance and stability are satisfactory, and if there are any errors or warnings in the system logs. You should also run some benchmarks and stress tests to evaluate the custom kernel's performance and reliability.
  
Booting a custom kernel from a USB drive is a convenient way to test it without affecting your main system. You can create a bootable USB drive with the custom kernel and the necessary files by using a tool such as dd or unetbootin. You should copy the custom kernel file (usually named kernel or kernel.gz) and the /boot directory to the root of the USB drive. You should also edit the /boot/loader.conf file on the USB drive to point to the custom kernel file. Then, you can plug the USB drive into your computer and select it as the boot device from the BIOS or UEFI menu.
  
Running benchmarks and stress tests is a useful way to measure and compare the performance and reliability of different kernels. You can use various tools and programs to run benchmarks and stress tests, such as sysbench, phoronix-test-suite, stress-ng, or cpuid. You should run the same tests on both the default kernel and the custom kernel, and compare the results. You should also monitor the system resources, such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and temperature, during the tests. You should avoid running other programs or tasks while running the tests, to avoid interference.
